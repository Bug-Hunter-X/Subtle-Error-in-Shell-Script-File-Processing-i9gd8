# Shell Script File Processing Bug

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in a shell script designed to process a file containing numbers. The script doubles each number read from the file and prints the result. However, it lacks proper error handling for lines that are not numbers, leading to unexpected behavior or silent failures.

The `bug.sh` file contains the buggy script, while `bugSolution.sh` provides a corrected version with robust error handling.

## Bug Description
The script fails to handle non-numeric input gracefully. If a line in the input file is not a number, the arithmetic operation `$((number * 2))` will result in an error, potentially stopping script execution or producing incorrect results.  The script also lacks error checks to ensure the file exists.

## Solution
The corrected script in `bugSolution.sh` includes improved error handling. It uses an `if` statement to check if the input line is a valid number before performing arithmetic operations. Error messages are improved for clarity and to indicate specific issues.
